                <h2><u>Anthony Bridgerton</u></h2>

                <p>
                    Anthony Bridgerton is the eldest Bridgerton son and the current Viscount Bridgerton. Upon the death of his father Edmund, he became the 9th Viscount Bridgerton and 
                    the head of the family. Anthony, the firstborn son and child of Viscount Edmund Bridgerton and his wife Violet, grew up the heir to his father. Seven more siblings followed after him.
                    In 1803, he watched his father get stung by a bee and die seconds afterward. He also watched his pregnant mother fall to pieces as a result. Upon his father's death, 
                    Anthony became the new Viscount. When his mother went into labor, the doctors pressured him to choose for them to save either Violet or the baby. Even after both 
                    mother and child survived the birth, Anthony watched his mother despair over losing her husband.
                    He attended Oxford where he met and befriended Simon Basset and Thomas Dorset.

                <h2><u>Benedict Bridgerton</u></h2>

                <p>
                    Benedict Bridgerton is the second Bridgerton child and son. Benedict accompanied his family to his sister's presentation to the queen at the start of the 1813 social season. 
                    He showed little interest in the societal goings-on. When his sister, Eloise, learned from her friend, Penelope, that one of the Featheringtons' maids was pregnant without 
                    being married, she became concerned it could happen to her, as she was unaware of how women become pregnant. When her mother refused to tell her, Eloise sat between Colin 
                    and Benedict, whom she assumed knew. Colin started to tell her, using farm animals as an example, but Benedict stopped him with a slap to his head.

                <p>
                    Colin Bridgerton is the third Bridgerton child and son. At the start of the 1813 social season, Colin attended social events with his family, 
                    including the newly-debuted Daphne. At the Danbury ball, Colin noticed Marina, whom he found very attractive, though he didn't know who she was. Despite this, 
                    he went to dance with her. The next day, he called on Marina at the Featherington house, though he was among many. At another event, Colin asked Penelope about 
                    Marina and learned she was ill. In her absence, he danced with Penelope after Cressida Cowper tried to interject and spilled her drink on her to get her out of the way.

                <h2><u>Daphne Bridgerton</u></h2>

                <p>
                    Daphne Basset (née Bridgerton) is the fourth Bridgerton child and eldest daughter.At the start of the 1813 social season, Daphne made her debut in front of the queen. 
                    Queen Charlotte looked at her and declared her flawless, 
                    instantly making her the most promising young lady in the circuit. This was also supported by Lady Whistledown's Society Papers, a leaflet being 
                    written by an anonymous society lady and distributed throughout town, which declared her the season's Incomparable.Daphne attended social events, 
                    meeting potential suitors. She quickly grew frustrated at her brother, Anthony, for dismissing all of her options. After escaping a conversation with Nigel Berbrooke, 
                    she ran into Simon Basset, who believed she was faking when she said she didn't know who he was. Then her brother appeared and recognized Simon as an old schoolmate, 
                    now the Duke of Hastings.
                </p>
                <h2><u>Eloise Bridgerton</u></h2>

                <p>
                    Eloise Bridgerton is the fifth Bridgerton child and second daughter.
                    At the start of the 1813 social season, Eloise accompanied her family as her eldest sister, Daphne, made her social debut. Eloise herself had been allowed another 
                    year before her debut. Eloise took no pleasure in attending balls and other social events, preferring instead to focus on her studies. When Penelope told Eloise 
                    that she knew an unmarried woman who was pregnant, though she pretended it was a maid, Eloise became concerned it could happen to her, as she was unaware of exactly 
                    how women became pregnant. She went to her family and asked her mother, though her mother refused to tell her, so she went to her brothers. Colin started to tell her, 
                    using farm animals as an example, but Benedict stopped him with a smack to his head. She then went to Penelope to find more information about the maid and was horrified 
                    to learn that the maid wanted to run away and marry her lover.
                </p>
                <h2><u>Francesca Bridgerton</u></h2>

                <p>

                    In 1813, on the day of Daphne's societal debut, Francesca accompanied the rest of her family so that Daphne could be presented to the queen. Shortly after this debut, 
                    Francesca left London to practice pianoforte with their Aunt Winnie. After being away for nearly the entire season, Francesca returned to London. She eagerly showed 
                    Daphne what she had learned, playing piano while Colin sang and the others danced. At the start of the 1814 social season, Francesca waited, along with the rest of her 
                    siblings and mother, for Eloise to get ready for her presentation. When she finally emerged, she warned them all not to say anything.

                    he flung his peas at Hyacinth, annoying her.
                    Gregory attended a picnic with his family, where he played while his older siblings socialized.
                    While their family discussed Daphne's social prospects, Hyacinth and Gregory played together on the sitting room floor.

                    She happily accompanied her family to the palace so Daphne could be presented in front of the queen and took interest in Daphne's courting. 
                    Hyacinth was present and very delighted when her mother received a letter from the queen inviting her to a private tea. While their family discussed Daphne's social prospects,

                    Violet discussed her excitement with her governess as she was having her hair braided. Later, the two went on a walk outside with Violet's horse where they discussed 
                    the king's new marriage and her mother's thoughts on the matter, with her governess telling her to not discuss her mother's thoughts with anyone outside of the family.

                    After learning it was a son, he took Simon out to show him off while Sarah died of a hemorrhage. When Simon was four and still not speaking clearly due to a stutter, 
                    the Duke ordered Simon out of his sight, saying Simon was dead to him. Simon continued to be schooled by nursemaids, though his father refused to see him. When he was six,
