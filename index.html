            Bridgerton is an American historical romance television series
            created by Chris Van Dusen for Netflix. Based on the book series by
            Julia Quinn, it is Shondaland's first scripted show for Netflix. The
            series is set during the early 1800s in an alternative London
            Regency era, in which George III established racial equality and
            granted many people of African descent aristocratic titles due to
            the African heritage of his wife, Queen Charlotte. The viewer is
            taken to observe the highly competitive social season, where young
            marriageable nobility and gentry are introduced into society.

            The first season debuted on December 25, 2020. The second season
            premiered on March 25, 2022. The third season was across two parts,
            which premiered on May 16 and June 13, 2024, respectively. The
            series was renewed for a fourth season in April 2021. The fourth
            season will be released in August 2026. In May 2023, Queen
            Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, a spin-off series focused on Queen
            Charlotte, was released.
